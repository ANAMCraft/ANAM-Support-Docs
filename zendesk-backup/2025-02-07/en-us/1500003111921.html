<h1>Are there order minimums?</h1>
<p>Order minimums will be applied based on the requirements of the makers selling products on Anam Craft. When viewing a product on the website, the order minimum will be displayed in the pricing information section of the product page, indicating the minimum USD amount required to purchase that item. Order minimum will also be displayed on thumbnail versions and product search pages for convenience.</p>
<p>Order minimums are especially important when conducting wholesale purchases, so we urge Makers selling products on our site to update this information should it change.</p>
