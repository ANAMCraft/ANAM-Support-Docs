<h1>Declining an Order / "I cannot fulfill an order"</h1>
<p>If you receive an order that you cannot fulfill or wish not to, you must contact the buyer* as soon as possible to notify them of the inability to complete the order. Following this communication, you will select "Cancel Order" with the Editing Order view and complete the pop-up detailing the reason for cancellation.</p>
<p>Cancellations or declining an order must be done within 72 hours of the order being placed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*If a buyer has initiated messages through your ANAM storefront, you can reach the customer directly through the Message Center in your Maker Portal. If you are unable to communicate, please contact support.</p>
