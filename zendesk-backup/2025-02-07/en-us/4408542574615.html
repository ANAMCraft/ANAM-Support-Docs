<h1>How do I track inventory?</h1>
<p>It's important to make sure product quantities and inventory are managed properly so there are no missed opportunities and buyers can add your products to their cart. The "<strong>Track Inventory</strong>" setting is <em>default</em> for each product. When a product's "Amount in Stock" level gets to zero, a buyer will not be able to purchase this product (it will show as Out of Stock). If you are tracking inventory, be sure to check your stock levels regularly. Alternatively, you can choose not to track inventory to avoid a product showing out of stock.</p>

<p>For Makers who craft to order, it is best to select "<strong>Do Not Track</strong>" in the Pricing/Inventory section of each product. This way you can leave Amount in Stock at "0" since there is no quantity on hand, and customers will not be deterred from adding your product to their cart.</p>
