<h1>How do I add or edit products?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your application has been approved (usually within 3-5 working days), you will receive a step-by-step guide on how to upload your product catalogue to your ANAM storefront as well as the login information to access your <a href="https://anamcraft.com/makerportal.php" target="_self">Maker Portal</a>. <br></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To add products to your storefront, navigate to the Products page within your Maker Portal. This will display any and all products you currently have uploaded to your portal. In order to create a new product, click the "Add New Product" button.</span></p>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://anamcraft.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6953134291223/Screen_Shot_2022-06-22_at_10.54.21_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-06-22_at_10.54.21_AM.png" width="148" height="50"></span></h2>
<p>From there, you will add information about your product, including name, product category, pricing, images, descriptions and more. From this page you are also able to "Track Inventory" if necessary, and add other inventory options. Once completed, click "Create" in the top right and your new product will be uploaded.</p>
<p>Once a product is created, you gain access to various features such as product variations, size and color options, and more. Your product will now be displayed in your main product page and on your storefront (pending admin approval).</p>
<h2>Editing Products</h2>
<p>Similar to the process of creating an item, navigate to your Products page and select the item you wish to edit. You are also able to edit items in bulk by selecting multiple items from the product page (highlighted blue) and use the "Edit Selected" button at the top of the product list. From there, you are able to edit many aspects of your products in bulk, and this process makes applying similar information across many like-products.</p>
