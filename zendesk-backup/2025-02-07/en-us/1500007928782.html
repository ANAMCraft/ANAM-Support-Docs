<h1>I have swatches instead of product images. How do I use these?</h1>
<p>The best way to help buyers purchase your products is to have photographed images of all products.</p>
<p>If instead, for example, you have a product with multiple color options and the images are swatches, upload those swatch images in the Product Options tab (see image below).</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<p>1. Create product with a primary product image within the general tab (photographed or lifestyle), and click Save. Navigate to the Product Options tab to create a new set of options, such as color, size, etc.</p>
<p>2. Label each of the options (or variants) under the Variants tab, and upload the appropriate swatch image for each one. This will allow buyer to quickly understand which option or color associates by showing a thumbnail image.</p>
<p>3. Use the description area in the main product page to best describe the product(s), detailing what variant (color, size, or scent) is photographed in primary image.<iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aBRC2jdKNiY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
