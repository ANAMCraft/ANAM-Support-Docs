<h1>Setting up your Buyer Profile</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>To sign in to your Buyer Account you must first be approved.  Once you have received your approval email you can follow the link from there or visit the <a href="http://www.anamcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANAM Craft homepage</a> and click the "<strong>Buyer Sign in"</strong> button at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Upon first sign-in, you will need to complete your profile by adding your store information, shipping address, and reseller/sales tax ID.</p>
<p>In your Buyer Dashboard you can also change your password, view order history, invoices, messages, and apply for 60-day net terms!</p>
