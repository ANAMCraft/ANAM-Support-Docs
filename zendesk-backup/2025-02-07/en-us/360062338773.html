<h1>How do I know when I have a new order?</h1>
<p>When you receive a new order through ANAM Craft Marketplace, you will receive notification of the order within your Maker Portal and a notification via email. You are able to view your order by navigating to the "Orders" tab or by following the appropriate notification.</p>
<p>Be sure to fulfill and ship orders according to your storefront "Ships within" timeline.</p>
