<h1>Understanding Order Status/Shipping Tracking</h1>
<p>Upon submitting a purchase, sellers will receive delivery information related to the order, including delivery address, delivery timeline, and requested products. Following shipment of the products using the shipping method chosen by the seller, delivery tracking information must be provided to the purchaser in order to receive updates on delivery status and any potential issues with products in transit. Any delays or issues that arise during shipment are not the responsibility of the seller.</p>
