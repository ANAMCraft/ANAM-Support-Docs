<h1>Do I need to confirm shipping with buyers?</h1>
<p>All buyers on ANAM Craft understand that shipping cost is calculated when order is ready to ship, and they are promised that it will stay below 40% of total cost of order. There is no need to confirm shipping costs with buyers. You can proceed directly with order fulfillment each time.</p>
