<h1>What is the selling criteria on Anam Craft?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Listing your products at the same prices as your other wholesale channels.</li>
<li>Fulfilling orders in a timely manner, concurrent to your ANAM storefront shipping timelines</li>
<li>Maintain quantity levels of products in stock at all times so you are not missing out on product orders</li>
<li>Not directing transactions off of ANAM Craft marketplace, including reorders. (We'll be working very hard on marketing, promotions, and buyer incentives to bring business to our makers 24/7, and hope our platform proves to be a valuable service with high rates of visibility.)</li>
