<h1>Where do I enter my EIN or Sales Tax ID?</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>It is important to add your <strong>EIN</strong> (Employer Identification Number) or <strong>Sales Tax ID</strong> within one week of gaining approval to shop on ANAM Craft, or before you submit your first order. Having this information in your Buyer Dashboard ensures a seamless order process, as international shipping carriers now require it.</p>
<p>To enter your EIN, navigate to your Buyer Dashboard and find the drop down "Sales Tax ID or Business Number" and fill in information here.</p>
