<h1>What is Quantity Step?</h1>
<p>When creating or editing a product, there are tools such as Minimum Order Quantity and <em>Quantity Step</em>. If a product has a Minimum Order Quantity of 3, then the <em>Quantity Step</em> is important for setting the number of products necessary to order above the minimum quantity.</p>
<p>Examples of using Quantity Step:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum quantity for Product A is 3, and you set a <em>Quantity Step</em> of 3. The buyer must purchase at least 3, but any higher amount ordered must be in multiples of 3 such as 6, 9, etc.<img src="https://anamcraft.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/5135003482519/Screen_Shot_2022-03-30_at_8.10.53_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-03-30_at_8.10.53_PM.png" width="480" height="179">
