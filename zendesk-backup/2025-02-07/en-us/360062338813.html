<h1>Managing Inventory/Stock</h1>
<p>In your Maker Portal, you have the ability to manage inventory using "Track inventory" or "Do not track" for each product:</p>

<p>All products default to "Track inventory," so be sure to change this if necessary. (As a Maker who crafts products per order, you may not need to track inventory.)</p>
<p>When tracking inventory, simply add to the "In Stock" field under Pricing/Inventory within the product listing or by inputting an amount under "Quantity" when viewing All Products (see below).</p>

<p>Remember, there are other ways to control how buyers order by using your <em>Minimum Order Amount</em> in your "General" account settings, or by using <em>Minimum</em> or <em>Maximum Order Quantity</em> amount at the product level.</p>
