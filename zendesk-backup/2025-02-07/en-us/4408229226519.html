<h1>Tips on uploading a Brand Image</h1>
<p>Your Brand image will be used to entice buyers to visit your storefront and view all of your beautiful products. This should be a square, high quality image of a <em>product</em> or <em>collection of products</em> that best represent your Brand. It's best to change this image regularly so that it always showcases your current or best product line. You will be able to assign photos to your storefront in the "Brand Images" tab (located by clicking "My Storefront" and "Brand Images" from the navigation bar.)</p>
