<h1>How do Backorders work on ANAM Craft?</h1>
<p>When a buyer submits an order that cannot be completely fulfilled, then it is time to use the tools to backorder or cancel products. This can be done in Step 1 of the order fulfillment process in your Maker Portal.</p>
<p><em><strong>*Helpful tip: Backordered Products Will Be Available Again Soon, Cancelled Products Will Not</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">How to Backorder or Cancel Products</span></span></strong></p>
<p>In Step 1 when "Editing Order," you may select any unavailable quantities within each product line by choosing "Backorder" or "Cancel."</p>

<p>When backordering products, you will be given a calendar (example above) to choose an approximate date of availability. Finish adjusting all unavailable products, add shipping, and click Save.</p>
<p>The buyer will see any and all backordered or cancelled products linked to the invoice they receive from ANAM Craft once order ships and is marked "Complete."</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Backordered Items Should Not Ship Until Confirmation from Buyer</strong></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">The backorder system on ANAM Craft was created to let buyers receive notification when purchased products become available again. They receive an email as well as a pop-up notification upon login to add newly available products to their cart if they are still interested. Therefore, items marked on "Backorder" should not automatically ship to buyer after order is marked Complete. To be proactive, you may contact the buyer from the original order letting them know the items are back in stock!</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Allow Buyers to Build a New Order with Backorders to Increase Sales</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Typically some time has passed while a buyer awaits product availability with backorders. Giving a buyer the chance to build a new order along with once-backordered products allows for additional product purchases!</p>
