<h1>How do I contact the Buyer?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be a time during order fulfillment when you need to ask the buyer a question or make an important note about a product, the order, etc. To contact the buyer, open up the order in your Maker Portal and select the gear drop-down (top right) and select "Contact Buyer." From here you can send a direct message to the buyer. <br></span></p>
