<h1>How do I order/arrange my products?</h1>
<p>A best practice to keep customers on your storefront is to arrange your products so that your most popular are at the top of your storefront. This can be done by ordering your products by number in your Maker Portal. When viewing All Products, you will see a column labeled "<strong>Product Position</strong>" for position. You can also toggle to reorder by clicking the "<strong>Product Position</strong>." column title.</p>

<p>From here, simply order products in numerical order. This can be done in single digits, by twos, by tens, etc. Don't forget to click <strong><em>save</em></strong> in the top right corner (next to the plus symbol) once you are done.</p>

<p>It is important to know that all products <strong>default to zero</strong>. You do not need to apply a number to each product, say if you would just like to showcase your top 10 products and let the rest appear shuffled. If this is the case, you will want to apply a higher number to these products (for instance "100"). This high number can be applied to all products that you would like to show under your top products.</p>
