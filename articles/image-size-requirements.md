## Image Upload Recommendations

When uploading products, we recommend using **web-optimized images**. The ideal image size for product images is a **square** format, approximately **1080x1080** pixels. 

The image should not exceed **3000 pixels** on the largest side, and the file size should be kept between **1-2 MB** for optimal performance.

## Storefront Banner Requirements

For your Maker **storefront banner**, we recommend a size of **1240 Ã— 380** pixels. This ensures that your banner looks sharp and professional.

## General Image Quality

While other images do not have specific size requirements, it is important that they are of good quality. High-quality images can significantly enhance the shopping experience.
