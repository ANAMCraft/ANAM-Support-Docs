## Step 1: Edit Order/Add Shipping

To view and fulfill the order, navigate to **Orders** in your portal. Select the appropriate Order # to view the order in detail. Before order fulfillment, ensure your Payout Settings information is correct and complete.

At the top of the order page, selecting the button will bring you to an 'Edit Order' page that allows for product quantity editing (if necessary) and inputting the **shipping cost**.

If you need to backorder a product from the order, select the drop-down for "Quantity Not in Stock," enter quantity, and label as "Backorder." Use the calendar to select the approximate date that the product will be available or back in stock. 

To cancel a product(s) that is no longer available, select "Cancel" (the calendar does not appear for this).

At the bottom of the Edit Order page, add the shipping cost in the appropriate field (it cannot exceed 40% of the order total).

## Step 2: Validate Payment

By selecting the validate payment button, you will confirm the buyer's payment method and prepare the order for shipment. You **cannot** go back to edit the order or add shipping cost after this step is confirmed. As you progress, Step 1 and Step 2 buttons will be **inactive**.

Before moving on to the last step, you will be required to enter the Carrier and Tracking number. Once the information is saved, you can move to Step 3.

## Step 3: Mark as Shipped

Once all shipping and tracking information is saved, the order is complete and ready to ship!
