## Best Practices for Product Ordering

When ordering your products, you can assign numerical values to each product. Here are some tips:

- Use single digits, pairs, or tens to arrange your products.
- Remember to click **save** in the top right corner after making changes.
- All products default to zero, so you only need to apply numbers to products you want to showcase prominently.
- For example, if you wish to highlight your top 10 products, consider assigning them higher numbers (like "100") to keep them at the top.

## Conclusion

Arranging your products effectively can lead to increased visibility and sales. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your top products are easily accessible to your customers.
