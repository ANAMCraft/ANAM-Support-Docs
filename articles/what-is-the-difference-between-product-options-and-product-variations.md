## Product Variations

### What are Product Variations?

Product Variations are essential when you need to track inventory or adjust pricing based on different attributes such as size, color, or metal type. Each variation is treated as its own product listing, allowing for individual controls on pricing, inventory, multiple-image uploads, and more.

## Product Options

### What are Product Options?

If you're creating products that have variants of the same price and do not require inventory tracking, then Product Options are the ideal choice. Using Options allows you to manage variants without cluttering your All Products list. This method is particularly useful for attributes like chain lengths, fabric colors, or custom names.

See this video for an example of a Product with Options: [Product with Options Video](//www.loom.com/embed/6b0ed6c000f04d03af4a758fc8c6bc96).
