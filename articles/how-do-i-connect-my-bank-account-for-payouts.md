## Why do I need to verify my account details?

Updating information about your business is required to help protect against fraud and stay current with Know Your Business (KYB) regulations. Payouts to your bank account will be paused if your information is not updated and verified.

## Who should complete verification?

Only those with sufficient permissions to edit banking details will be able to complete verification. In practice, this means that the Owner of the account on ANAM Craft should be the only person who is authorized to complete verification.

## How do I complete verification?

Please follow the steps below:

1. Click "Payout Settings" from the navigation bar on the left side of the screen

## What information do I need to provide?

Required information varies by country. For non-US based brands, you may need to send a business verification document to comply with the latest banking regulations.

## What happens if I do not have all the information available at that time?

The steps should be completed all at once to ensure proper setup, but if the process is disrupted for any reason, you can contact [support@anamcraft.com](mailto:support@anamcraft.com) for assistance in finishing your setup.

## What happens after I submit my information?

You're all set! If there is anything further required by our payment processor, we will be in touch.

## Why and how is my data used?

ANAM Craft uses a Stripe-based payment processor, which is a global, trusted payments provider for online payments. All information sent through these forms is secure and is not saved in the portal. The data is requested to verify your bank account so that we maintain compliance with all relevant laws and regulations for your region. You can learn more [here](https://stripe.com/ie/privacy).

## Conclusion

In summary, connecting your bank account for payouts is a crucial step during your onboarding with ANAM Craft. Make sure to verify your account details to avoid any disruptions in payouts.
