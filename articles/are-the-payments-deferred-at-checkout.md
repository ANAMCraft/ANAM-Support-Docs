## How Deferred Payment Works

2. **Authorization but No Immediate Charge**:
   - Your credit card will be authorized for the purchase amount. This means the amount will not be charged to your card, only ensuring the card is valid.
   - However, your card will not be charged immediately. The actual charge will only occur when your order is shipped.

3. **Order Processing**:
   - Once your order is confirmed, it will enter our processing system. During this period, the seller prepares your items for shipment.

4. **Shipping and Final Charge**:
   - When your order is ready and shipped out from the seller, your credit card is charged for the total amount of the purchase plus shipping.
   - You will receive a confirmation email with the shipping details, tracking, and the final charge on your credit card.
