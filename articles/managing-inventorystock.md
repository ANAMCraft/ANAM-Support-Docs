## Understanding Inventory Tracking

All products default to "Track inventory," so be sure to change this if necessary. As a Maker who crafts products per order, you may not need to track inventory.

### Inventory Tracking Options

- **Track Inventory:** This option allows you to keep track of stock levels.
- **Do Not Track:** If you craft products per order, you may choose this option.

## How to Manage Inventory

When tracking inventory, simply add to the "In Stock" field under Pricing/Inventory within the product listing or by inputting an amount under "Quantity" when viewing All Products.

## Conclusion

Managing your inventory effectively is crucial for ensuring a smooth purchasing experience for your buyers. Be sure to utilize the tracking options and set appropriate order limits to meet your business needs.
