## Order Confirmation and Delivery Information

Upon submitting a purchase, sellers will receive essential delivery information related to the order. This includes the delivery address, delivery timeline, and the products requested by the buyer.

## Shipping and Tracking Responsibilities

Once the products are shipped using the chosen shipping method, it is crucial for sellers to provide delivery tracking information to the purchaser. This allows buyers to receive updates on the delivery status and any potential issues with products in transit. 

**Important Note:** Any delays or issues that arise during shipment are not the responsibility of the seller.

## Handling Shipment Issues

In the event of delays or issues with the shipment, buyers should:

- Check the tracking information provided by the seller for updates.
- Contact the shipping carrier for more detailed information regarding the shipment status.
- Reach out to the seller if there are persistent issues or concerns.

Understanding order status and shipping tracking is vital for both buyers and sellers. By staying informed and maintaining communication, potential issues can be addressed promptly.
