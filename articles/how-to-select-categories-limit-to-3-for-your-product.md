## Selecting Categories

When listing your product, you should select up to **3 categories** that directly relate to your item. This helps ensure that your product is easily discoverable by potential buyers.

## Examples of Category Selection

For instance, if you are listing a Claddagh pendant, you should select the primary category as “Necklaces and Pendants - Jewelry - Type.” Additionally, you should also include the “Claddagh - Jewelry - Style” category.

## Important Notes

*Please note: All products in a sub-category will automatically show if a buyer is looking at the parent category. Therefore, there’s no need to select all categories. For example, if you select "Type" and "Jewelry," all products from sub-categories will display when a buyer browses through all Jewelry.*

## Conclusion

In summary, selecting the right categories is crucial for your product's visibility. Limit your selections to three relevant categories to optimize your listing.
