## Printing the Invoice

Upon order fulfillment, a **printed invoice should be added to the inside of the box** before shipment. This can be done directly from the Order page in your [Maker Portal](https://anamcraft.com/makerportal.php).

After adding the shipping cost, carrier, and tracking number, the order will show a status of "Complete." You can find the Print Invoice (pdf) button on the right side of the order details page.
