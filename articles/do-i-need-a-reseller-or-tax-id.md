A Reseller ID is a tax identification number that allows businesses to purchase goods without paying sales tax. This ID is essential for retailers looking to buy wholesale products.

## Why is it Necessary?

ANAM Craft Marketplace is a trade-only platform where we vet our retailers prior to authorizing any purchases. While the marketplace is publicly accessible for browsing, a Reseller ID is required to complete transactions. This ensures that only authorized retailers can purchase wholesale goods.
