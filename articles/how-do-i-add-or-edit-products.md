## Adding Products

To add products to your storefront, navigate to the Products page within your Maker Portal. This will display any and all products you currently have uploaded to your portal. In order to create a new product, click the "Add New Product" button.

From there, you will add information about your product, including name, product category, pricing, images, descriptions, and more. You can also "Track Inventory" if necessary and add other inventory options. Once completed, click "Create" in the top right and your new product will be uploaded.

Once a product is created, you gain access to various features such as product variations, size and color options, and more. Your product will now be displayed on your main product page and on your storefront (pending admin approval).

## Editing Products

Similar to the process of creating an item, navigate to your Products page and select the item you wish to edit. You can also edit items in bulk by selecting multiple items from the product page (highlighted blue) and using the "Edit Selected" button at the top of the product list. From there, you can edit many aspects of your products in bulk, making it easier to apply similar information across many like-products.

## Conclusion

In summary, adding and editing products in your ANAM storefront is a straightforward process that allows you to manage your inventory effectively. For further assistance, please reach out to our support team.
