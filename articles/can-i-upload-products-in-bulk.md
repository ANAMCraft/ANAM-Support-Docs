## Step 2 - Product Images

Please provide the corresponding high-resolution image(s) for each listing above, labeled by either product name or code to match.

**Picture files must be in JPEG or PNG format (not HTML).**

Please send us images in a Google Drive folder shared with the email address: **makers@anamcraft.com**. Make sure the driveâ€™s access is [set to public](https://www.faire.com/support/articles/360031158092) so that ANAM's content team can access them to ensure there are no delays on activating your Storefront/Products.

We will select the best images to feature on our site, and even our Instagram and Facebook Pages to showcase your brand. Any additional *lifestyle photography* you have for your brand is welcomed and encouraged for continued marketing and showcasing.

## Exporting from Online Marketplaces

If you already use an online marketplace such as Shopify, you can export a CSV of your existing products using the steps provided in the video below:
