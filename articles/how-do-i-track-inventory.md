## Introduction

It's important to make sure product quantities and inventory are managed properly so there are no missed opportunities and buyers can add your products to their cart.

## Understanding Inventory Tracking

The "Track Inventory" setting is **default** for each product. When a product's "Amount in Stock" level gets to zero, a buyer will not be able to purchase this product (it will show as Out of Stock). If you are tracking inventory, be sure to check your stock levels regularly. Alternatively, you can choose not to track inventory to avoid a product showing out of stock.

## Best Practices for Makers

For Makers who craft to order, it is best to select "**Do Not Track**" in the Pricing/Inventory section of each product. This way, you can leave Amount in Stock at "0" since there is no quantity on hand, and customers will not be deterred from adding your product to their cart.

## Additional Tools for Control

### Other tools to control purchasing:

- **Minimum Order Quantity:** When using this field, it is suggested to stay within a range of 3-12. If left at 0, there is no minimum requirement and buyers can still purchase.
- **Maximum Order Quantity:** When using this field, it is suggested to stay within a range of 10-25. If left at 0, there is no maximum requirement and buyers can purchase freely.

**Please note:** Buyers will still need to meet your Minimum Order Amount, so please keep this in mind when adding minimums to each product.

## Conclusion

By effectively tracking inventory and utilizing the right settings, you can enhance your sales opportunities and improve customer satisfaction. Be sure to implement these practices to manage your products efficiently.
