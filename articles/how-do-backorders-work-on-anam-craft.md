## How to Backorder or Cancel Products

In Step 1 when "Editing Order," you may select any unavailable quantities within each product line by choosing "Backorder" or "Cancel."

When backordering products, you will be given a calendar to choose an approximate date of availability. Finish adjusting all unavailable products, add shipping, and click Save.

The buyer will see any and all backordered or cancelled products linked to the invoice they receive from ANAM Craft once the order ships and is marked "Complete."

## Important Guidelines for Backordered Items

**Backordered Items Should Not Ship Until Confirmation from Buyer**

The backorder system on ANAM Craft was created to notify buyers when purchased products become available again. They receive an email as well as a pop-up notification upon login to add newly available products to their cart if they are still interested. Therefore, items marked on "Backorder" should not automatically ship to the buyer after the order is marked Complete. To be proactive, you may contact the buyer from the original order letting them know the items are back in stock!

## Encouraging Additional Sales with Backorders

Typically, some time has passed while a buyer awaits product availability with backorders. Giving a buyer the chance to build a new order along with once-backordered products allows for additional product purchases!

## Conclusion

In summary, managing backorders effectively can enhance customer satisfaction and potentially increase sales. Make sure to communicate with buyers about their backordered items and encourage them to take advantage of new product availability.
