## How to Decline an Order

If you receive an order that you cannot fulfill or wish not to, you must contact the buyer as soon as possible to notify them of your inability to complete the order. Following this communication, you will select "Cancel Order" in the Editing Order view and complete the pop-up detailing the reason for cancellation.

## Important Timeframe

Cancellations or declining an order must be done within **72 hours** of the order being placed. It is crucial to adhere to this timeframe to ensure a smooth process.

## Communication with Buyers

If a buyer has initiated messages through your ANAM storefront, you can reach the customer directly through the Message Center in your Maker Portal. If you are unable to communicate, please contact support at [support@anamcraft.com](mailto:support@anamcraft.com).
