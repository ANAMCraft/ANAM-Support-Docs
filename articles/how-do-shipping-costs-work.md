## Understanding Shipping Costs

Shipping costs will be calculated by the Maker of the goods once your order is ready. This means that the final shipping fee may vary based on the seller's location, the weight of the items, and the shipping method chosen.

## Shipping Cost Limitations

As promised at checkout, shipping costs will never be more than 40% of your total cost of goods. This ensures that you are not overcharged for shipping, allowing for a more transparent purchasing experience.

## Conclusion

In summary, shipping costs are determined by the Maker of the goods and are capped at 40% of your total order cost. If you have any further questions regarding shipping or your order, please feel free to reach out to our support team.
