## What is Quantity Step?

When creating or editing a product, tools such as Minimum Order Quantity and *Quantity Step* are utilized. If a product has a Minimum Order Quantity of 3, then the *Quantity Step* is crucial for setting the number of products necessary to order above the minimum quantity.

## Examples of Quantity Step

- **Example 1:** The minimum quantity for Product A is 3, and you set a *Quantity Step* of 3. The buyer must purchase at least 3, but any higher amount ordered must be in multiples of 3 such as 6, 9, etc.
